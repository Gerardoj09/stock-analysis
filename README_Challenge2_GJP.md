## Overview of Project
### A variety of different stocks need to be analyzed by Steve, who is working to manage his parents funds to invest in green energy stocks. A dataset has collected in Excel by Steve with all the needed information about twelve different stock prices. Further post-processing will be needed to attain this problematic in a reusable automated way free of user error.

## Purpose and Background

### The purpose of the project is to use VBA to analyse the acquired information in an efficient and an efective way in order to help Steve to diversify his parents funds processing a handful of green energy stocks to make data-driven decisions; this will be achieved automating a vesatile subroutine with the capacity to process this kind of provided information.

## Results

### In less than a quarter of second, the analysis generates condensed and precise conclusions categorized by twelve Ticker types, Total Daily Volume, and the Yearly Return in percentage. The information from the 2018 year has thrown only two out of twelve stocks have growth highly and the rest have shrunk at different rates. Talking about the 2017 year information, the analysis revealed that all stocks had had a healthy growth during the year except for the TERP stock decreased slightly.The analysis can be run with different information with the same structure to populate a well described and concise table.

## Summary

### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general
#### In general, some obvious advantages of refactoring code are intended to improve its design to increase the quality of a code by maximizing the performance of the process in terms of time and memory avoiding redudant sub procedures. Another benefit of refactoring code is to keep it maintained by constantly working in its main features. For the contrary, refactoring code may produce disadvantages depending on the application. Some negative consecuences could be a to create a very specific solution, negatively affecting its vesatility if it is for a big application; another one could be to disable or change important features that wasn't considered in the test case, and also could be risky if a developer does not undestand completely the function of the code; without mention that may be expensive.

### Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script
#### A very positive advantage of refactoring code in VBA is to decrease the execution time by simplifying redundant procedures, for instance, dismantling a redundant nested for-loop. Also it is beneficial to detect repetitive variables that can change their scope from procedure to global. In addition, it will be an advantage to add comments to explain in detail what is every task about an opportunity areas. Counterly, one disavantage of refactoring a VBA script could be to make it difficult to read by addiong complex -but more appropiate- commands, to simplify its functionality. VBA has many readable commands but other very complex.
